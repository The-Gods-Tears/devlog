# There and back again
## A devlog?
Welcome to the development blog about [The Gods Tears](https://www.thegodstears.com), a fantasy rpg videogame developed in C++ and Unreal Engine 5.
I will try to make a weekly post about how the development is progressing and what cool features I'm working on at the moment, but I cannot guarantee regular updates.

## Why?!
That is a fair question, I do not expect this devlog to be read by a lot of people to be honest... But I want to keep record of the small progress I make and I want some accountability, and a devlog will force me to commit to some targets.

## Ok what can we expect
There will be some technical posts about the main areas of the development. Because the game is scheduled to be released as a beta of how the final product will look like only the most important systems will be included from the start:
- Age system
- Factions system
- Magical craft/research/development system
- Necromancy system (realistic necromancy)
